# HTML DSL with MPS
---
This is a project showcasing a domain-specific language (DSL) for generating HTML code, implemented using the MetaProgramming System (MPS) by JetBrains.

# Getting started
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Open MPS and import the project.
* Once the project is imported, you can run my example file in sandbox solution with `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + F9`

# DSL syntax
The DSL allows you to create basic HTML tags, such as `html`, `head`, `body`, `p`, `a`, and `img`

# Conclusion
It was a pleasure to discover MPS and write my first dsl. Thank you for this opportunity.
